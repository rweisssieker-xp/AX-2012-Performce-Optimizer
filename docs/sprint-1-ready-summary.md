- [ ] Backlog reviewed and approved

### Sprint Kickoff Meeting Agenda
1. **Sprint Goal Review** - 4 foundational Quick Wins
2. **Story Overview** - Walk through all 4 stories
3. **Task Assignment** - Assign stories to developers
4. **Dependencies Discussion** - Identify blockers
5. **Definition of Done** - Confirm criteria
6. **Daily Standup Schedule** - Set meeting times
7. **Sprint Demo Planning** - Plan end-of-sprint demo

### Week 1 Focus

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Graph Visualization Library
**Decision:** Evaluate GraphSharp.Wpf in Week 1
**Rationale:** Mature library, good performance, MIT license
**Fallback:** Custom WPF control if GraphSharp doesn't work

### 2. Audio Library
**Decision:** Use NAudio for sonification
**Rationale:** Industry standard, MIT license, full-featured
**Alternative:** System.Media (limited)

### 3. Development Approach
**Decision:** Incremental development with proof-of-concepts
**Rationale:** Reduces risk, enables early validation
**Method:** Build → Test → Iterate

### 4. Performance Targets
**Decision:** <2s load times, <30s analysis for Quick-Fix
**Rationale:** Maintains user experience
**Monitoring:** Performance benchmarks established
